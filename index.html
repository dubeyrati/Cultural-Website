                Vibrant, opulent, and mesmerisingly beautiful are what spell out Rajasthani culture. Rajasthan, which means “the abode of kings”, gets its name from the many Rajput kings who ruled the state before British rule. Over centuries, Rajasthan has been ruled by various Rajput, Maratha, and even Muslim rulers, which has led to its diverse culture. The state is home to a colourful bouquet of awe-inspiring monuments, expansive forts, magical palaces, lively folk dances, alluring handicrafts, and some delectable delicacies that are unique only to Rajasthan.

                                <p>Rajasthan boasts a rich heritage of art and culture. The Rajput clan particularly has made hefty contributions to Rajasthani art and culture. Rajput paintings flourished in the 17th and 18th centuries, where artists would paint elaborate scenes from the Hindu epics Ramayana and Mahabharata.<br>

                                    Rajasthani paintings were mainly meant to be kept in boxes or albums. Displaying the paintings was not a very common practice and hence, miniatures were the most preferred medium. However, paintings were also done inside the walls of the palaces, various havelis and other places of importance.<br>
                                    
                                    Gemstone paintings are very famous in Rajasthan. Originating in the Pink City, Jaipur, gemstone painting is created using semi-precious and precious stones like emerald, rubies, and sapphires of different colours. The gemstones are ground to fine dust and then stuck to the sheet with the help of a pinhead point. This painting is entirely made by hand and hence, the artist’s skill and imagination are what brings out the vibrancy in these paintings. Since they’re made with all-natural stones, these paintings never fade and lose colour.

                                <p>Rajasthani architecture is influenced by the mixed variety of people that have stayed and ruled over the royal state. The architecture is seen to be a regional variant of the style prevalent across northern India. Most of the population in Rajasthan has primarily been Hindu, with a small number of Jains. The blend of these two religions has led to a lot of temples being built here. <br>

                                    Around the 11th century, a distinctive architectural style emerged in Rajasthan called Maru-Gurjar. This style is popular not only in Rajasthan but in the neighbouring state of Gujarat as well. The etymology behind the name relates the ancient names of the two states, Marudesh for Rajasthan and Gurjaratra for Gujarat. The style is common amongst Hindu temple architecture but has also been popularised by Jain temples. A prime example being the Dilwara Jain Temple in Mount Abu. A telling feature of Maru-Gurjar architecture is that almost every surface is adorned with elaborate carvings. <br>
                                    
                                    Additionally, there are some distinct pieces of architecture commonly found across Rajasthan such as Baoris (step wells) and Chatris (cenotaph memorials).

Ride an elephant up the massive ramps of Amer Fort, marvel at the panoramic views from the ramparts of Jaisalmer Fort and Mehrangarh Fort, or get lost in the splendour of Jaipur's City Palace. And these are just the tip of the architectural iceberg!
                                    When one thinks of Rajasthan, it is impossible not to associate it with the magnificent forts that reside in the state. With over a hundred fortifications on hills, six hill forts of Rajasthan have been clustered and given the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) World Heritage Site status. The Six Hill Forts of Rajasthan are Chittor Fort at Chittorgarh, Kumbhalgarh Fort at Kumbhalgarh, Ranthambore Fort at Sawai Madhopur, Gagron Fort at Jhalawar, Amer Fort at Jaipur, and Jaisalmer Fort at Jaisalmer.
